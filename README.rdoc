Complete replication from {rails-4-omniauth-using-devise-with-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin}[http://sourcey.com/rails-4-omniauth-using-devise-with-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin/]

Works good for {fb}[www.facebook.com] and {twitter}[www.twitter.com]

LinkedIn email and name isn't getting stored, even though API call is returning that information.

Twitter doesn't return email, so another step is being added in the app.

Register a new app if you don't have one and generate App ID and App Secret token
